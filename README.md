<h1>Description</h1>
GWET is a simple acceptance testing framework that allows you to write readable and straight-forward acceptance tests.
Ideally it should be possible to transform the requirements of user stories and customers straight into GWET.

GWET follows the general acceptance testing order of:
* Given: The setup and enviroment of the test.
* When: The action that is executed.
* Then: The expected outcome of the action.
